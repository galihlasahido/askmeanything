# Ask Me Anything (AMA)

Welcome! This repository is my public **Ask Me Anything** space.

You can open a GitHub **Issue** to ask me a question about *anything*—tech, career, projects, learning, opinions (within reason), or random curiosity. I’ll respond when I can, and the conversation stays public so others can learn too.

## ✅ How to ask a question

1. Go to the **Issues** tab
2. Click **New issue**
3. Use a clear title (example: `How did you learn React?`)
4. Ask your question with enough context
5. Submit 🎉

**Ask here:** `Issues -> New issue`

## 💡 What makes a good AMA question?

- Be specific: “How do I start with backend?” → “How would you learn backend in 30 days if you were starting today?”
- Add context: what you tried, what you’re building, constraints you have
- One issue per topic (keeps things organized)

## 🏷️ Labels (optional but recommended)

If you want to keep things tidy, you can label issues like:

- `career`
- `frontend`
- `backend`
- `devops`
- `open-source`
- `learning`
- `project-feedback`
- `random`

## 📌 Rules / Guidelines

Be respectful. No harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.

I may not answer:
- Requests for private/confidential info
- Anything illegal/harmful
- Questions that require personal data about others
- Spam or low-effort content

## 🔒 Privacy note

Please don’t share sensitive personal info (yours or anyone else’s).  
If something should be private, don’t post it here.

## ✅ Before posting, check:

- [ ] Has this been asked already? (Search Issues)
- [ ] Is the title clear?
- [ ] Did I include enough context?

## 📜 License

Unless stated otherwise, my answers are shared publicly for discussion and learning.  
If you’d like to reuse something, please credit the source.
